Welcome to this repository! This directory contains a collection of datasets that I personally use as toy datasets for exploration and learning. These datasets are easy to read and understand, making them perfect for testing, learning new concepts, or exploring data-related methodologies.

Feel free to use these datasets for your own learning and exploration. If you find any improvements or have any interesting datasets to add, your contributions are most welcome.

Please note that these datasets are intended for testing and learning purposes only. They may not be factually correct or verified, so they should not be used for any other purposes.

Enjoy exploring and happy learning!
